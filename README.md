# DOMUS-V2
This is the second version of my DOMUS home automation project. This version is far more open. 
You can add users and devices to a sqlite database (python tool included) and then log into the webpage to control them.
IMPORTANT: frame.html and frameLogin.html must be placed in the Templates folder on linux. Otherwise change filepath

This is seperate from the previous version because it works differently (and I haven't spent as much time working on the web design).
